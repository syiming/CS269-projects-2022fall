> Imitation learning is wildly used in Reinforcement learning field, and allow the agent to mimic the action of a human. Imitation learning is also used in autonomous driving. However, simple imitation learning via behavior cloning is not sufficient as driving senarials are sometimes very complex. In this project, we will explore the combination with imitation learning and other reinforcement learning methods to handle complex senarials. 
<!-- (prev proposal)> Ususally driving involves multiple intelligent agents, intelligent machine or human. With more information cooperated, agents may performs differently to achieve their goals. In this projects, we want to research about Reinforcement Learning (RL) based method such that all the agents collaborate with each other to achieve the best goal in total. -->

## Introduction 

<!-- As 5G techniques becomes more mature, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) becomes possible. This allows vehicles to communicate with any entity that may affect, or may be affected by, the vehicle. A vehicle may use these information to act differently to achieve the final goal.  -->

## Related Work


## Proposed Work
Our project should be mainly two parts. In the first part, we will reproduce the result using imitation learning. In the second phase, we will try to add policy or policy based learning to encourage the desired behavior and punish the undesired behavior. We will test these under restrictions such as stop sign, speed limitation and so on.

## Expected Result
We expect the result with imitation learning plus other reinforcement learning, we will reach much better result on complex senarios.
